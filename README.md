# Overview
We at Uber are planning to explore and contribute to OpenStreetMap in New Zealand. This project will be an internal analysis for evaluation only. This project won't involve any public display of OSM data in any Uber application or service. We do not plan to make any large-scale, machine generated edits for this project. All edits will be made by a small team of individuals based in Palo Alto, California, USA. The team will be using the available data sources in the JOSM tool for their corrections and validations. The edits will be made according to the Organized Editing Best Practices and NZ guidelines. In addition, Uber employees based in New Zealand will be able to participate in this project by leveraging their local knowledge to help identify data issues. 

For this project, our team will focus on adding and modifying the following OSM features: 
1. Road network includes (Class, Turn restriction, Directionality etc)
2. Display map features (Building Footprints, Parks, Airports etc.)

# Edit Guidelines
The edits will be made according to the [Organized Editing Best Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organized_Editing_Best_Practice) and [NZ guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_New_Zealand).

# Data sources
All available data sources in the JOSM tool for New Zealand.

# Tools
We will use [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) to make these edits.

# Changeset comments
The team will use the change-set comments as per the [OSM Changeset Guidelines](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)

# Quality assurance
All changes will undergo a verification process before submission.
